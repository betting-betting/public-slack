# public-slack

This repo contains the files to run a slack chat bot. This bot allows me to control the creation/running/killing of screen sessions on my linux server. It controls 4 sessions which are responsible for running the 4 sections of this project (odds/scores/positions/strategies). I also use this slack bot in other repos in order to notify me of any new positions or hedges. I also get notified why positions settle.
